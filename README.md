# CS501

1. Submit all programs for an Assignment in a single .zip or .rar file

2. Do not send the .class files

3. All input to a program must be validated and echoed back to the user

4. All input has rules for validity and should be communicated to the user explicitly, best as part of the prompt or in associated documentation

5. Exception handling starting assignment 4

6.  Prompt the user for input with a message indicating
	a.  Very briefly what the program will do or is for,
	b.  What input is expected, such as an number (integer), a file name, or a, String such as the name of a student, and
	c.  Special formatting instructions, such as separating entries with spaces or commas when more than one entry is expected as in, for instance, “Enter the x- and y-coordinate of a point separated by a space and without parentheses.”

7. The program descriptions and prompts should be right before the user is expected to enter the inputs.

8.  Starting with exercises from Chapter 3, your program should check the user input for such validity and when input fails to follow these rules what is not valid must be communicated to the user.

9.  Starting with exercises from Chapter 4, after invalid input is identified the program should allow the user to re-enter the input.  This loop should continue until the program executes successfully.  From this assignment on exception handling is to be used for input validation.  Assignment 4 contains videos and example files.
